# Code Raid

A fast and convenient way to have access to the 10,000 most well-know 4-digit combinations used to break into any base in Facepunch Studio's popular multiplayer survival video game, Rust. 

## Description

Ever wanted to break into a base as quickly and efficiently as possible? Now you can! Simply grab some of your favorite friends and create a room with the name of your choice. If every user is connected to the same server, all of your friends should be able to see the room you created. Now all you guys have to do is enter in the code that is on screen to the base you're attempting to raid. Every 'Next' button click (no matter the user) should generate the next latest, most popular code. This prevents entering any duplicate codes and speeds up the raiding process. Have fun!

### Instructions

- Make sure server is up and running and go to the web address (search up how to host web site if not working)
- In the text area, enter a name for the room to-be
- In the 'Rooms' box, select the room you just made or one that has already been created
- You should now see the latest code on-screen: try using it to break into the enemy base!
- If that didn't work, click 'Next' to go to the next most popular 4-digit combination that has not been seen yet
- If you'd 'like to see previous codes, simply click 'Back'

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
